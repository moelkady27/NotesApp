## Libraries and Technologies Used

* **Navigation Component**: One activity contains multiple fragments instead of creating multiple activities.
* **Retrofit**: Making HTTP connections with the REST API and converting meal JSON files to Kotlin/Java objects.
* **Room**: Save meals in the local database.
* **MVVM & LiveData**: Separate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.
* **Coroutines**: Perform some code in the background.
* **View Binding**: Instead of inflating views manually, view binding will take care of that.
* **Glide**: Cache images and load them in `ImageView`.

Proudly made in Kotlin.
